Momentum: Your All-in-One Personal Productivity Hub
Welcome to Momentum, your personal dashboard designed to bring clarity, focus, and organisation to your life. In a world where we use different apps for tasks, notes, habits, and goals, Momentum unifies them all into a single, beautiful, and intuitive interface.

This application is built for individuals who want to manage their daily jobs, plan their future, build good habits, and keep track of their inspirations‚Äîall in one place.

Key Features: What Can You Do with Momentum?
Momentum is divided into several powerful, interconnected modules. Here‚Äôs how each one helps you.

1. The To-Do List: Your Command Center
This is the heart of your daily and weekly planning. It‚Äôs split into two powerful views that work together perfectly.

üìã What's the Plan? (Your Default View)
This view gives you a high-level overview of your priorities, broken down into logical timeframes.

Today's Jobs: This is your action list for the day. You can quickly add tasks and assign them a priority color (e.g., Red for "Must Do"). Any task you add here automatically appears on today's date in the "Bonds Planning" calendar.

This Week: This box is a summary of your week. You cannot add tasks here directly. Instead, it automatically shows you all the tasks you have scheduled for the current week in the "Bonds Planning" calendar. It‚Äôs the perfect way to see what your week looks like at a glance.

Monthly Milestones: This is for your big-picture goals for the month. These items are separate from your daily tasks. You can assign a priority colour and track their progress using a simple status dropdown: Not Started, Ongoing, or Completed.

üóìÔ∏è Bonds Planning (Your Detailed Calendar)
This is a weekly calendar where you can get into the details.

Schedule Anything: Plan tasks for any day of the week, past or future.

Prioritize with Color: Use the simple color system to mark tasks by importance.

Set Reminders: Assign a specific time to a task and ask the app to remind you. A pop-up will appear when your task is due, ensuring you never miss a deadline.

2. Red Alerts: Your "Must-Focus" Hub
The Red Alerts page is your central hub for everything that is urgent and important. It automatically gathers every item you've marked as high-priority from all sections of the application.

You will see "Must Do" tasks from your To-Do list.

You will see high-priority goals from your Career and Life Plans.

You will see the books and movies you've marked as important.

Each alert provides clear details, telling you exactly where it came from (e.g., "From: Career Plan - Quarterly") and its current status, so you always have full context.

3. Habit Tracker: Build Consistency
This module helps you build and maintain good habits.

Track Your Progress: See your entire week on a simple grid and mark your habits as complete each day.

Add Your Own Habits: While the app comes with helpful defaults, you can add and delete any habit you want to track, making it fully personal.

Weekly Analysis: At the bottom, a visual chart shows your consistency for the week with simple progress bars, helping you stay motivated.

4. Career & Life Plans: Your Long-Term Vision
These sections are dedicated to your long-term goals, keeping them separate from your daily noise.

Plan for the Future: Organize your goals into Quarterly, Yearly, and 5-Year plans.

Prioritize Your Ambitions: You can mark a goal as "High Priority," which will automatically add it to your Red Alerts page, keeping your most important ambitions top of mind.

5. Notes: Your Digital Notebook
A simple, clean space to capture your thoughts.

Pin Important Notes: Pin any note to keep it at the top of your list.

Highlight Key Info: Use the highlight feature to make important text stand out.

6. Book & Movie Lists: Your Personal Library
Keep track of media you want to consume or have already completed.

Separate Sections: Your books and movies are organized into their own distinct lists.

Track Your Status: Mark each item as Not Started, Ongoing, or Completed.

Never Lose Your History: Completed items remain in your list unless you manually delete them, creating a perfect log of what you've read and watched.

How Does It All Work?
The application is built on modern, secure technology to ensure your data is always safe and in sync.

Real-Time & Secure: It uses a service from Google called Firebase. This means that whenever you add or change something, it's saved instantly. Your data is tied to your personal account and is completely private.

Personalized Experience: With a Light/Dark mode toggle and the ability to upload your own background image, you can make the application truly your own.

Tech Stack & Architecture
This project was built using a modern, scalable, and maintainable tech stack, perfect for a dynamic single-page application (SPA).

Frontend:

React: The core of the application is built with React, utilizing functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo) for efficient state management and a declarative UI.

JavaScript (ES6+): The application is written in modern JavaScript, leveraging features like arrow functions, modules, and promises.

Backend as a Service (BaaS):

Google Firebase: The entire backend is powered by Firebase, which allows for rapid development and scalability.

Firestore Database: A real-time NoSQL database used to store all user data (tasks, notes, habits, etc.). Its real-time nature ensures that the UI is always up-to-date instantly.

Firebase Authentication: Handles secure user sign-up, login, and session management with unique user IDs.

Styling & Design:

CSS-in-JS: Styling is handled directly within the React component using modern CSS features like Flexbox, Grid, and CSS Variables (Custom Properties) to create a fully responsive and themeable (Light/Dark mode) interface.

Responsive Design: A mobile-first approach was taken to ensure a seamless experience across all devices, from phones and tablets to desktops.

Momentum is more than just a to-do list; it's a unified system designed to help you manage your time, build a better routine, and stay focused on what truly matters.
